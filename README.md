#  Calculator

Whether you're at school and you need to use a calculator for a math test, or at a restaurant and need to whip out a calculator for splitting the bill with your date, our **calculator** is here for you. <br /> Made to be a better version of the iPhone calculator (hire me apple). <br /><br /> Build one yourself, it's great for: 
 - Learning JavaScript Math functions
 - Learning and applying CSS grid layout
 - Adding and using eventListeners to your JavaScript
### Tech
This site uses the following languages, principles & softwares:
  - JavaScript
  - HTML
  - SCSS / CSS
  
And of course my calculator itself is open source, so feel free to pick and choose bits you like to host on your own GitHub!

### Todos
